-------------------

<p>The HITECH Act, was enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to promote and expand the adoption of health information technology, specifically, the use of electronic health records (EHRs) by healthcare providers. Through the increased use of EHRs, the government aims to achieve the goal of a National Health Information Network, that will result in improved quality of care, patient safety, and lower costs</p>

<p>Under this act, $34 billion dollars of incentive is issued to eligible healthcare organizations in order to promote the use of EHRs. In order to qualify for the incentives, an organization has to purchase a government-approved EHR system, and demonstrate meaningful use of the system by implmenting a sorted list of objectives. </p>
