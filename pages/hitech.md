-------------------

<p>The <b>HITECH Act of 2009</b>, was enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 to promote and expand the adoption of health information technology, specifically, the use of electronic health records (EHRs) by healthcare providers. Through the increased use of EHRs, the government aims to achieve the goal of a National Health Information Network, that will result in improved quality of care, patient safety, and lower costs</p>

<p>Under this act, $34 billion dollars of incentive is issued to eligible healthcare organizations. In order to qualify for the incentives, an organization has to purchase a government-approved EHR system, and demonstrate its <b>meaningful use</b> of the system by implementing a series of objectives. </p>
<br>

###### Meaningful Use:

- There are <a href="resources/MU_SCC_CombinedGrid.pdf" target="_blank">25 detailed requirements</a> issued by the Department of Health and Human Services. Each organization is required to meet the 15 objectives from the core set and at least 5 of 10 objectives from the menu set.
- Failure to comply even one of the requirements disqualifies the provider from the incentive program. Additionally, delaying or not implementing EHR will result in a penalty for the practice.
