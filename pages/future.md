- <p>The extensive use of Machine Learning(ML) and Artificial Intelligence(AI) has been one of the hot topics in information technology. Health IT is following this tread and using ML/AI to improve our healthcare experience. EHR allows immense data aggregation to train the health modules to alleviate some burdens off healthcare team members. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org" target=_blank>Mayo Clinic</a> has shown many promising research projects involving ML/AI.</p>
- <p>Once sufficiently trained, EHR in hospitals will not only intelligently document patients' health information, but also will analyze these information to predict and prevent adverse incidents from happening. These intelligent system will assist nurses and doctors to proactively care deliver care to those in need. The <a href="https://bluedot.global/" target=_blank>BlueDot System</a> intelligently detected an abnormal infectious disease outbreak, later known as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8HSCMYalvs" target=_blank>COVID-19</a>.</p>
- <p>Portable smart devices can also monitor a patient health conditions at home, and generate health data to be incorporated into a patient's treatment plans. These devices will also alert the patient and the provider for abnormal findings. These innovations offer opportunities for nurses to provide preventative care and distant care outside the hospital settings.</p>
