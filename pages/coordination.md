<p>In patient-centered healthcare settings, doctors make vital decisions everyday. Although often being overlooked, nurses play an important role to bridge the care between patients and doctors. Even though EHR has brought many benefits for nurses, it is important for nurses to understand its significant impact on the providers and the beneficiaries.</p>

###### EHR and doctors:
<p>EHR is more than just a documentation tool that transcribes all paper charts into electronic storage. It functions as a clinical decision support platform to assist doctors to practice safe medicine. It combines a patient's past medical records and current diagnostic instruments into a comprehensive picture that allows clinician to establish the best course of corrective and preventative treatment for the patient.</p>


###### EHR and patients:
<p>EHR enables patients to more actively engage in their healthcare, and to build confidence with the healthcare team. It's a channel that delivers the right care to the right patient at the right time. Patients now have more autonomy and trust during each interaction with the medical personnel.</p>
