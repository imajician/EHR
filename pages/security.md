<p><b>The HIPAA Privacy Rule</b> establishes a set of national standards for the use and disclosure of individually identifiable
health information – often referred to as protected health information – by covered entities, as well as standards for
providing individuals with privacy rights and helping individuals understand and control how their health information is
used.</p>

<p><b>The HIPAA Security Rule</b> establishes national standards to protect individuals’ electronic protected health information
that is created, received, used, or maintained by a covered entity. The Security Rule requires appropriate administrative,
physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronic protected health
information. The HIPAA Security Rule requires providers to implement security measures, which help protect patients’
privacy by creating the conditions for patient health information to be available, but not be improperly used or disclosed.</p>
