<p>The <b>HITECH Act</b> has outlined appealing incentives to promote EHR adoption. However, there could be difficulties for organizations to make changes in order to meet the compliance with the regulations. Adopting an EHR just to get bonus money is like having a child so you can get a tax deduction. In order to unlock the full potential of EHR, it takes a collective effort to creatively implement the latest technology into the vast health care system.</p>

- <p>User Satisfaction is an important factor for clinicians to adapt to this electronic atmosphere of healthcare. "When clinicians feel the EHR is a help rather than a hindrance, they are more likely to want to stay at their organization," said the <a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/nurses-most-likely-clinicians-leave-jobs-new-klas-survey-shows" target="_blank">KLAS report</a>. Nurses and other clinicians are to recognize EHR's values in <a href="https://nlmdirector.nlm.nih.gov/2021/08/11/25x5-decreasing-documentation-burden-on-u-s-clinicians/" targe="_blank">decreasing documentation burden</a>, and consequently decreasing burnouts and increasing retention rates. Developers are encouraged to develop more productivity-promoting systems.</p>

- <p>Organizations are encouraged to share and seek advices during the implementation process. One can also use a buddy system when first start to implement EHR, suggested by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j18abr_oOY0" target="_blank">Dr. Mike Zaroukian</a>. Nurses and clinicians can further advance EHR uses by help share thought leader emerging practices with professional organizations, such as <a href="https://www.ania.org/" target="_blank">American Nurse Informatics Association</a> and <a href="https://www.himss.org/" target="_blank">Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society</a>.</p>
