- <p>Medication Safety: Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) allows providers to write safer orders by incorporating checks for drug-drug interaction, drug-allergy interactions, dosage recommendations. Bar Code Medication Administration (BCMA) helps nurses further reduce medication errors with real-time medication verification and documentation</p>
- <p>Accessibility: EHR decreases delay in care by allowing instant accessibility to patient records to multiple users from multiple locations. Nurses are able to conveniently retrieve and update patient information, including demographics, allergy, medications, surgeries, risk factors, etc. Nursing notes are also instantly populated.</p>
- <p>Interoperability: A dynamic and secure platform that promotes information sharing between multiple disciplines. This information sharing does not only benefit each individual patient, but also pushes the advancement of medicine collectively.</p>
- <p>Patient Education: Building trust and confidence with patients by allowing the transparency of their charts through features such as MyChart. In the process, patients become more well-informed and educated on their health.</p>
